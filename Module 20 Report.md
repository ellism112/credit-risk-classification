# Module 20 Report

## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this project is to use machine learning to analyze the creditworthiness of borrowers based on a dataset of historical lending activity. Logistic regression was used to determine whether a loan to a borrower in the testing set would be low-risk or high-risk. Factors considered in this analysis include the loan size, interest rate, borrower income, borrower debt to income ratio,	the borrower's number of accounts, derogatory marks against the borrower, and their total debt.

## Results

* Machine Learning Model 1:
   * Accuracy: 99%
   * Precision: 92% (macro average)
   * Recall scores: 97% (macro average)

## Summary

The logistic regression model was fairly accurate and could be a good tool for lending companies to use to assess the credit-risk of certain loans.
